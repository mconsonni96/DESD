Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/AXI4Stream_UART_0/U0/FIFO_DATA_RX/gnuram_async_fifo.xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/AXI4Stream_UART_0/U0/FIFO_DATA_RX/gnuram_async_fifo.xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg/ENARDEN (net: design_1_i/AXI4Stream_UART_0/U0/FIFO_DATA_RX/gnuram_async_fifo.xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/ena) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/AXI4Stream_UART_0/U0/UART_Manager_inst/FIFO_DATA_RX_wr_en_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
