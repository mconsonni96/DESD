WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to any ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. 
CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1348] Reset pin /AXI4Stream_UART_0/rst (associated clock /AXI4Stream_UART_0/clk_uart) is connected to asynchronous reset source /reset.
This may prevent design from meeting timing. Please add Processor System Reset module to create a reset that is synchronous to the associated clock source /clk_wiz_0/clk_out1.
WARNING: [BD 41-927] Following properties on pin /packetizer_0/aclk have been updated from connected ip. They may not be synchronized with cell properties. You can set property on pin directly to confirm the value and resolve the warning.

WARNING: [BD 41-927] Following properties on pin /depacketizer_0/aclk have been updated from connected ip. They may not be synchronized with cell properties. You can set property on pin directly to confirm the value and resolve the warning.

WARNING: [BD 41-1771] Block interface /AXI4Stream_UART_0/UART has associated board param 'UART_BOARD_INTERFACE', which is set to board part interface 'usb_uart'. This interface is connected to an external interface /UART_0, whose name 'UART_0' does not match with the board interface name 'usb_uart'.
This is a visual-only issue - this interface /AXI4Stream_UART_0/UART will be connected to board interface 'usb_uart'. If desired, please change the name of this port /UART_0 manually.
